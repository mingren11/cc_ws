[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /opt/ros/humble/share/ament_cmake_test/cmake/ament_cmake_test-extras.cmake:19 (option):
  Policy CMP0077 is not set: option() honors normal variables.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0077" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, option is clearing the
  normal variable 'BUILD_TESTING'.
